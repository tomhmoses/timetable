# Instructions

• Open your my.bham timetable and select to view it as:
  - All term time, all week, all day, list timetable (with calendar dates)

• To get the HTML code, use Chrome (or firefox, but it might not work) and right click next to the word Monday and select 'view frame source'. See here for example: https://ibb.co/efaW4K

• Copy and paste this into the currently empty frame.html file.

• Then run the python program (main.py). This will create you a CSV file which you can import into most popular calenars, such as google calendar. 

• I would strongly recommend creating a 'new calendar' (not a new account) to import your timetable into. this way you can hide your timetable if needed and when your timetable is updated you can delete your current one and re-add the new one.

• Save the CSV file using the three dots in the file menu (as shown here: https://ibb.co/jWAebz). It will download as a zipped file.

• To see how to import your timetable to your calendar try a Google search with CSV and your calendar app.

• If your calender only accepts imports of ical format, use this tool: https://manas.tungare.name/software/csv-to-ical/

• Disclaimer:
  - You are responsible for checking all imported events are correct. I am not responsible if anything goes wrong with the import progress. Please continue to check your online timetable as it may change.

• If you do have any issues please do contact me using this form: https://goo.gl/forms/S7TPvd7yPHHcESu72
