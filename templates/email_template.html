                Think of it like a bake sale, but you get to use the service rather than getting a cupcake.

                I'm currently trying to raise money for breast cancer now, I would really appriciate it if you donated around £2-£5 to this great cause.
            </p>
            <p>
                Breast cancer touches almost everybody, whether it's through a direct relative, a friend, or a friend's family. This great cause is actively working towards the goal of stopping all deaths caused by breast cancer by 2050, your donations help keep the constant research funded and on track.

                Almost done...

            <p>
                Or potentially already done. If this is one of two emails you have just recieved then you are already all set up. If you did not receive another email just now then that is because you didnt use the email linked with your google account... but you can still import the calendar here (it just might not work as seamlessly):
